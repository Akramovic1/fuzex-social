# Architecture

## Overview

`fuzex-social` is the social/atproto layer of FuzeX. It runs alongside a
Bluesky PDS on a single Hetzner VPS and exposes endpoints used by:

- The Bluesky atproto network (handle resolution via `/.well-known/atproto-did`)
- The FuzeX mobile app (tipping resolver via `/v1/resolve/:handle`)
- Future authenticated flows (account creation, session minting — Phase 2)

## Domain architecture

The project deliberately splits its hostnames across two domains:

| Domain | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `fuzex.app` | Marketing site, web app (`app.fuzex.app`), booking/payments API (`api.fuzex.app`), AI agent. Email reputation for the main app on `email.fuzex.app`. |
| `fuzex.social` | atproto identities, PDS, fuzex-api, user handles. Synthetic email domain `email.fuzex.social` for phone-only signups. |

Why split:

- `username.fuzex.social` reads cleanly as a social handle. `username.fuzex.app`
  was ambiguous (sounds like an app subdomain).
- Federation hygiene — relays and other PDS instances see only `fuzex.social`
  for atproto interactions; outages on the main app domain don't affect them.
- Independent scaling/operations — DNS or cert issues on one domain don't
  cascade to the other.
- Frees `api.fuzex.app` for the existing FuzeX product backend (booking,
  payments) without colliding with the planned production fuzex-api hostname.

See [ADR 0007](./decisions/0007-migrate-to-fuzex-social-domain.md) for the
full decision and [`migration-fuzex-app-to-social.md`](./migration-fuzex-app-to-social.md)
for the migration playbook.

                            External services (cloud, untouched):
                            - Firestore     (existing FuzeX product data)
                            - Firebase Auth (user authentication)
                            - Secret Manager (wallet private keys)
                            - Resend         (SMTP for PDS)
```

## Data ownership

| Data | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Existing FuzeX product data (profiles, bookings, events, wallet metadata) | Firestore | Already there, real-time sync, mobile offline-first, no migration risk |
| Atproto records (posts, likes, follows, repos) | PDS internal SQLite | That's what PDS is for |
| Wallet private keys | Secret Manager | Encrypted, audited, never on application server |
| `did ↔ handle ↔ wallet_address` mapping | Postgres on VPS (NEW) | Localhost queries, social-layer-specific, low risk if lost (rebuildable) |
| Audit logs of social-layer actions | Postgres on VPS | Queryable, cheap, doesn't bloat Firestore |
| Authentication | Firebase Auth | Already there |

This is a deliberate **hybrid**: existing data stays put; only NEW
social-layer data lives in the VPS Postgres.

## Components

### Caddy (reverse proxy)

- Auto-issues SSL via Let's Encrypt with on-demand TLS
- Routes by hostname:
  - `pds.dev.fuzex.social`, `*.pds.dev.fuzex.social` → PDS (port 3000)
  - `dev-api.fuzex.social` → fuzex-api (port 3001)
  - `*.dev.fuzex.social/.well-known/atproto-did` → fuzex-api
  - everything else under `*.dev.fuzex.social` → 404

### Bluesky PDS

- Stock Bluesky PDS install (Docker)
- Handles atproto records, federation with the relay, posting
- Uses Resend for SMTP

### fuzex-api (this repo)

- Node.js 20 + Hono + Drizzle ORM
- Runs under pm2
- Stack: TypeScript strict, ESM, Pino logging, zod validation, Jest tests
- Endpoints (Phase 1):
  - `GET /health` — liveness + DB ping
  - `GET /.well-known/atproto-did` — handle resolution from Postgres
  - `GET /v1/resolve/:handle` — public tipping resolver
- Endpoints (Phase 2):
  - `GET /v1/username/check` — pre-signup availability check
  - `POST /v1/atproto/createAccount` — Firebase-authenticated account creation
  - `POST /v1/atproto/getSession` — issue PDS session for an existing user

### Firebase (external dependency, Phase 2)

- **Firebase Auth** — issues ID tokens used by Phase 2 endpoints; verified
  via `firebase-admin` SDK on every request.
- **Firestore** — `Users/{firebase_uid}` document is the source of truth
  for profile data (walletAddress, username, name, dateOfBirth,
  gender). fuzex-api reads it at signup with retry; see
  [decisions/0005-firestore-as-source-of-truth-for-profile-data.md](./decisions/0005-firestore-as-source-of-truth-for-profile-data.md).

### PostgreSQL

- Postgres 16 on the VPS
- Listens on localhost only (firewalled from public internet)
- Database `fuzex_social`, user `fuzex_api`
- 3 tables: `users`, `audit_logs`, `invite_codes`
- Phase 2 extends `users` with profile fields (`email`, `phone_number`,
  `display_name`, `date_of_birth`, `gender`, `auth_provider`, etc.) and an
  encrypted per-user PDS password (`pds_password_encrypted`). See
  [decisions/0006-encrypted-pds-passwords-in-postgres.md](./decisions/0006-encrypted-pds-passwords-in-postgres.md).

## Request flows

### Atproto handle verification

```
Bluesky AppView wants to verify "akram.dev.fuzex.social"
  ↓
Bluesky calls https://akram.dev.fuzex.social/.well-known/atproto-did
  ↓
Cloudflare DNS returns VPS IP
  ↓
Caddy receives request
  - matches *.dev.fuzex.social block
  - matches /.well-known/atproto-did
  - reverse-proxies to localhost:3001 with original Host header
  ↓
fuzex-api wellKnownAtprotoDid route
  - reads Host header: "akram.dev.fuzex.social"
  - parseHandle() → username "akram"
  - validates format + checks reserved list
  - UsersRepository.findByUsername("akram")
  - returns DID as text/plain (no trailing newline)
  ↓
Bluesky verifies handle matches PLC document
  ↓
Handle valid ✅
```

### Tipping flow (future use, endpoint exists today)

```
FuzeX mobile app: user taps "Tip @sara.fuzex.social"
  ↓
App calls https://dev-api.fuzex.social/v1/resolve/sara.fuzex.social
  ↓
fuzex-api resolveHandle route
  - parses handle, validates, checks reserved
  - findByUsername → user record
  - returns { did, walletAddress, chain, tippingEnabled }
  ↓
App reads walletAddress, executes wallet transfer directly
  (FuzeX backend is NOT in the funds path — it's a name resolver only)
```

### Account creation (Phase 2)

```
Mobile app
  1. Firebase Auth signup → Firebase ID token
  2. Embedded wallet system creates wallet → wallet address
  3. Mobile writes Users/{firebase_uid} in Firestore
       { walletAddress, username, name, dateOfBirth, gender }
  4. POST https://dev-api.fuzex.social/v1/atproto/createAccount
       Authorization: Bearer <firebase-id-token>
                                    ↓
fuzex-api createAccount flow
  - firebaseAuthMiddleware: verifyIdToken via firebase-admin
  - idempotency: return existing identity if user already in Postgres
  - FirestoreUserService.fetchUser(uid) (with 3 retries on missing doc)
  - validate age >= MIN_USER_AGE (default 13)
  - pre-check username uniqueness in Postgres
  - PdsAdminClient.createInviteCode (if PDS_INVITE_REQUIRED)
  - PdsAdminClient.createAccount({ email, handle, password, inviteCode })
       (email is real or phone-synthesized — see ADR 0004)
  - PdsAdminClient.putProfile (best-effort; failure is logged, not fatal)
  - usersRepository.createWithProfile (encrypted PDS password)
  - auditLogsRepository.create (action='account_created')
  - return { did, handle, displayName }
```

## Why these choices

See ADRs in `docs/decisions/` for the reasoning behind:
- Postgres on the VPS (not Firestore for this layer) — `0001`
- No Redis cache in Phase 1 — `0002`
- Existing Firestore data stays in Firestore — `0003`
- Synthetic email for phone-only users — `0004`
- Firestore as source of truth for profile data — `0005`
- Encrypted PDS passwords in Postgres (Phase 2) — `0006`

## Security

- Postgres binds to localhost only
- Caddy auto-renews SSL; on-demand TLS is gated by the PDS's `/tls-check`
  ask hook so we don't issue certs for arbitrary hostnames
- fuzex-api validates and lowercases all handle input before any DB query
- Reserved usernames are checked BEFORE the DB query (defense in depth)
- All errors are routed through one handler; raw stack traces never leak
  to clients
- `pino` redacts auth/cookie/password/token/secret paths from logs
- Database password and other secrets live ONLY in `/opt/fuzex-social/api/.env`
  (chmod 600), never committed
- pm2 runs as root on the dev VPS; production should run as a dedicated
  unprivileged user (Phase 2 hardening)
